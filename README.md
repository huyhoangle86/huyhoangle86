# Hey ðŸ‘‹, What's up 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on gettting AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification.

:smiley: I'll update certification status and how I study everyday, stay tune.!
##### Here are some projects I've done
- Mask detection and emotion recognition deploy on Jetson nano.
- With Ultra lightweight model achieved relatively high FPS .I'll publish the code soon
- Eyes Tracking project, preventing you not to sleep when drive.
